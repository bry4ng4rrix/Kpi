                I'm a 20-year-old intern, married to a terribly boring man. He is
                so obsessed with his job that he no longer has time for bedroom stories,
                and he never even asks me if I want sex. It seems crazy that I
                chose to marry him, right? It's just that I didn't think he would
                prefer his work to ass.

              And now... I'm stuck in a meeting on the 50th floor of a tower in
              New York, with only one obsession on my mind: to come. The board of
              directors' meeting had started ten minutes ago. I was sitting there,
              falsely calm. But I couldn't hear a word anymore. I was obsessed
              with the liquid heat that was already flooding my thighs under my
              tailored skirt. You have to have the image in mind to understand my
              torment. I am not the type of woman you forget. I'm 5'9, I have very
              pale skin, long curly hair that cascades down my back, and a nice
              round behind. But the worst thing is what I hide under my strict
              blouse. I'm a 34DD, and today, my chest seemed to weigh a ton,
              compressed in that too-tight fabric.

              I was on the verge of exploding in front of my colleagues. I made up
              an emergency to run and lock myself in the private executive
              bathroom. Once the lock was drawn, alone facing my reflection in the
              large mirror, I couldn't hold back anymore.

            <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed text-lg">
              I started to <span className="font-bold text-pink-400">touch</span> myself,
              gently at first. My breasts were heavy and swollen, my nipples were
              hardening so much that it became painful. I used my left hand to knead
              my chest, I felt their weight, their warmth... It was obscene.

                Then my right hand slipped downwards. Over my waist, my wide hips...
                down to my crotch. It was soaked. It was pulsing inside. A kind of
                deep, insatiable itch, as if my body was begging to be filled. The
                more I caressed myself, the more that warm liquid flowed down my
                thighs. I couldn't control myself anymore.

              I spread wide facing the mirror. I needed more. I grabbed my favorite
              toy. When I slid it inside me... <br />
              <span className="font-bold text-2xl text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-rose-500 to-pink-500">HOLY FUCK</span>. The sensation was too strong. It

              I saw myself in the mirror: head tilted back, mouth open, eyes rolled
              back, my breasts bouncing to the rhythm of my violent thrusts. I
              screamed. I squirted. Everywhere. It was dirty, it was animalistic,
              and it was the best feeling of my life.

                I filmed everything. Everything. You can see the inside, you can

                and totally real.
