                I'm a 20-year-old intern, married to a terribly boring man. He’s so obsessed with his job that he has no time left for the bedroom, and he never even asks if I want sex. It seems crazy that I chose to marry him, right? I just didn't think he'd prefer his work over my ass.

              And right now... I'm stuck in a meeting on the 50th floor of a New York skyscraper, with only one obsession in mind: cumming.
The board meeting had been going on for ten minutes. I was sitting there, fake calm. But I couldn't hear a word anymore. I was obsessed with the liquid heat already flooding my thighs under my pencil skirt.
You need to have the picture in your head to understand my torture. I'm not the kind of woman you forget. I'm 5'9", very pale skin, long curly hair cascading down my back, and a nicely rounded ass. But the worst part is what I'm hiding under my strict blouse. I'm a 34DD, and today, my chest seemed to weigh a ton, compressed in this fabric that was way too tight.

              I was on the verge of exploding in front of my colleagues. I faked an emergency to run and lock myself in the private executive restroom. Once the lock clicked, alone facing my reflection in the large mirror, I couldn't hold back anymore.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed text-lg">
              I started to <span className="font-bold text-pink-400">touch</span> myself,
             gently at first. My breasts were heavy and swollen, my nipples hardening so much it was becoming painful. I used my left hand to knead my chest, I could feel their weight, their heat... It was obscene.

            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-rose-500 pl-6 py-3 text-gray-300 italic bg-gray-800/50 rounded-r-lg">

                Then my right hand slid down. Over my waist, my wide hips... down to my crotch. It was soaked. It was pulsing inside. A sort of deep, insatiable itch, as if my body was demanding to be filled. The more I caressed myself, the more this hot liquid ran down my thighs. I couldn't control myself anymore.

             I spread my legs wide facing the mirror. I needed more. I grabbed my favorite toy. When I slid it inside me...  <br />
              <span className="font-bold text-2xl text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-rose-500 to-pink-500">FUCK</span>. The sensation was too strong. It rubbed against my walls, fast, hard, deep.

            <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed text-lg">
              I saw myself in the glass: head back, mouth open, eyes rolling back, my tits bouncing to the rhythm of my violent thrusts. I screamed. I squirted. Everywhere. It was dirty, it was animalistic, and it was the best feeling of my life.
I filmed everything.
